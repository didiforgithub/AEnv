You are playing Connect-Four against a strategic opponent on a 6x7 grid. Your goal is to be the first to create four of your disks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) before your opponent does the same. You play first and are represented by "1" on the board, while your opponent is "2". When you drop a disk in a column, it falls to the lowest available position due to gravity. You have a maximum of 40 turns to win the game, so plan your moves carefully to both create winning opportunities and block your opponent's potential wins. The opponent uses smart heuristics and will try to win immediately when possible or block your winning moves.
