You are managing a farm in Backwards Valley, a place where interactions may not follow ordinary intuition. Your goal is to maximize Farm Value over 40 steps by observing how the environment responds and adapting your strategy accordingly.

What to expect:
- Some actions may have counterintuitive effects compared to conventional farming.
- Crops, animals, and villagers respond to your interactions in consistent but non-obvious ways.
- Farm Value reflects overall progress across agriculture, animal care, and social relations.

General guidance:
- Explore the farm layout (fields, pens, and houses) and interact with nearby entities.
- Run small, controlled experiments to infer how different actions influence state.
- Adjust your plan as you learn the environmentâ€™s consistent response patterns.

Plan routes and timing carefully to make the most of limited steps, and use your observations to discover effective behaviors.
