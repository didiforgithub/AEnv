You are managing an alien colony on a hostile planet. Your goal is to grow the colony population from 10 to 50 inhabitants while keeping them happy. The alien world operates under different principles than Earth - resources and buildings with frightening names may actually have beneficial effects. You must discover the true nature of these misleadingly-named elements through experimentation. Pay attention to how your actions affect population and happiness levels to uncover which resources and buildings are truly helpful. Environmental conditions like seasons and weather also influence the effectiveness of your actions. Success requires both strategic resource management and careful observation of cause-and-effect relationships in this counter-intuitive alien ecosystem.
