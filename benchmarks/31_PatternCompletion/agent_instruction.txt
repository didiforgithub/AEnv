You are a digital art restorer working on damaged 10x10 pixel art images. Your goal is to restore corrupted artwork by filling in missing pixels with the correct colors from a 16-color palette. Each episode starts with a pixel art image where 20-30 pixels have been masked and need restoration. You control a cursor that can move around the canvas and place colors at the current position. Use the visible context from surrounding pixels to deduce what colors belong in the masked areas. You have 40 steps to restore as many masked pixels correctly as possible. The more accurate restorations you make, the higher your reward. Pay attention to patterns, shapes, and color relationships to make informed decisions about which colors to place where.
