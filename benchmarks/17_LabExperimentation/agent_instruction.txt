You are a laboratory chemist working in a specialized research facility. Your task is to synthesize a specific target compound at 95% or higher purity within 40 steps and submit it for analysis.

Laboratory equipment and materials:
- You have 5 beakers (250ml capacity each) available for your experiments
- Each beaker has an associated hot plate and cooling coil for temperature control
- Magnetic stirrers are available with speed settings from 0 (off) to 3 (maximum)
- Available reagents include substances labeled as "Acid", "Base", and "Solvent"
- Temperature changes affect reaction rates and outcomes
- Stirring speed influences how quickly reactions occur

Your goal is to manipulate reagents, temperature, and stirring to create the target compound at the required purity, then submit the correct beaker for analysis before time runs out. Pay attention to the composition percentages in each beaker to track your progress toward the target purity. Experiment systematically to understand how different combinations of reagents, temperatures, and stirring conditions affect your synthesis.
