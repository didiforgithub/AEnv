You are controlling a forklift agent in a warehouse logistics puzzle. Your task is to organize the warehouse by pushing all cargo boxes onto their designated loading dock tiles within 40 steps. The warehouse is a 10x10 grid with walls forming corridors and storage areas. You can move in four directions (North, South, East, West), and when you move into a box, you will push it one space further in that direction if the destination is clear. Success requires getting all 3-5 boxes positioned on dock tiles before your 40-step time limit expires. Plan your moves carefully - boxes pushed into corners or blocked positions may make the puzzle unsolvable.
