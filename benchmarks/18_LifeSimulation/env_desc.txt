Background:  The environment depicts a compact, 15×15 valley farm surrounded by a small hamlet.  Fields, barns, a market stall and three villagers’ cottages are laid out anew at the beginning of every episode, yet once the layout is fixed the geography never shifts again during that run.  The player-agent starts the day with modest resources—some seeds, a bucket of water, a small stock of animal feed and a handful of gift items—and has exactly fifty in-game decisions before nightfall.  Within that tight horizon it must explore an only partially visible map, learn where valuable sites are located, and orchestrate a schedule that turns soil, livestock and social ties into profit and reputation.

Objective:  The agent’s sole purpose is to maximise cumulative, strictly non-negative reward earned before the fifty-step limit expires.  Reward is granted for harvesting crops, collecting animal products, selling goods for coins and improving relationships with the three villagers.  There is no notion of debt, decay or penalty; every correct or productive act can only increase the running total.

State Setup:  At reset, a pseudorandom generator (seeded when requested) chooses coordinates for four crop fields, three barns—each holding one predefined animal species—and three fixed home tiles for the non-player villagers.  Initial soil tiles are empty, animals begin hungry and each villager’s relationship score is set to an even multiple of five between 0 and 40.  The agent’s inventory opens with five seeds, five units of water, three units of animal feed, three gift parcels and zero coins, crops or animal products.  Internally the environment stores the full 15×15 map, time stamp, exact crop stages, precise animal hunger timers and continuous relationship scores, but only a filtered slice is ever revealed.

Actions:  Twelve discrete moves are available every step: cardinal motion north, south, east or west; planting a seed on bare soil when seeds remain; watering a planted tile; harvesting a mature plant; feeding the on-tile animal when feed is held; collecting any product that a currently sated animal has generated; handing a gift to an adjacent villager; liquidating all saleable goods at the market; or waiting.  Attempting an illegal act—for example watering empty ground or feeding without feed—leaves the agent in place, still consumes one step and otherwise mirrors a legal wait.

State Transition Rule:  Movement shifts the agent one tile if no obstacle blocks the way.  PlantSeed converts seed and soil into the “seedling” crop stage.  WaterCrop advances the resident crop exactly one growth level; two successful waterings therefore move a new seedling through “growing” to “mature”, and mature crops never regress.  HarvestCrop removes a mature plant, adds one harvested crop to inventory and frees the soil tile.  FeedAnimal toggles that animal’s hunger status to “sated” for ten subsequent steps; while sated, an internal counter ticks and at every fifth tick deposits one product for later collection.  CollectProduct transfers the product into inventory and resets the animal’s production counter without altering hunger.  GiveGift consumes one gift, raises the target villager’s relationship by a deterministic, species-independent increment and immediately shifts the villager’s displayed mood toward friendliness if the threshold is crossed.  SellAtMarket empties all coins-earning items—crops and animal products—into the market’s ledger, multiplies the base price by an average of current relationship multipliers and credits the result to the coin balance.  Wait passes time without side effects.  Every state change is deterministic given the preceding state and chosen action, ensuring repeatability under a fixed seed.

Rewards:  The scheme is cumulative.  Each unit of harvested crop grants +0.1.  Each animal product collected is worth +0.2.  Each point of relationship gained through gifting produces +0.5 multiplied by the raw relationship delta, providing an immediate incentive for social activity.  Finally, when goods are sold the agent instantly receives 0.1 times the number of coins issued by the market.  Because all coefficients are positive and no events reduce reward, the running total is monotonically increasing.

Observation:  At every time step the agent perceives a five-by-five egocentric grid centred on its own tile.  Each cell supplies the tile type—distinguishing empty soil, seeded soil, growing crop, mature crop, barn, specific animal sprite, villager sprite, obstacle or market.  A single additional flag on that central tile conveys the exact crop growth stage, animal hunger state or villager mood if such an entity sits there.  Beside the spatial snapshot, the agent reads its inventory counts for seeds, water, harvested crops, animal feed, collected products, coins and gifts.  Relationship values with the three villagers are exposed but discretised to the nearest multiple of five so that fine-grained credit assignment still requires experimentation.  Finally a countdown reveals how many of the fifty steps remain.  Nothing else—no absolute coordinates, no unseen crop timers, no hidden villager paths—is revealed, obliging the agent to build an internal map and schedule.

Termination:  The episode ends automatically after the fiftieth action or whenever an external controller calls reset.  Resource exhaustion never terminates play; if seeds, water or gifts run out, only the corresponding actions become ineffectual.

Special Features:  To promote learnability every behavioural rule—crop water requirements, animal production cadence, gift-to-relationship conversion and pricing formula—is constant across all episodes.  Difficulty arises from spatial reasoning and time allocation rather than from changing rules or stochastic penalties.  A reproducibility flag allows experimenters to lock the random generator and obtain identical maps and villager attitudes for debugging or curriculum construction.  The guarantee of strictly positive, additive rewards eliminates sparse or ambiguous feedback, letting agents evaluate the benefit of nearly every productive step while still navigating a partially observed and resource-constrained world.
