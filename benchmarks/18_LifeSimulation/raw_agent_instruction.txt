You are a farmer in a 15x15 valley with 50 steps to maximize your rewards before nightfall. Your goal is to efficiently manage crops, animals, and villager relationships to earn the highest possible cumulative reward. You start with limited resources: 5 seeds, 5 water units, 3 animal feed, and 3 gifts. The valley contains 4 crop fields, 3 barns (with cow, sheep, and chicken), 3 villager cottages, and 1 market. You can only see a 5x5 area around you, so exploration is crucial. Plant seeds on soil, water them twice to grow mature crops, then harvest for +0.1 reward each. Feed hungry animals and collect their products every 5 steps for +0.2 reward each. Give gifts to adjacent villagers to improve relationships (+0.5 per relationship point gained), which increases market prices. Sell crops and animal products at the market for coins (+0.1 per coin earned). Plan your route and actions carefully as you have limited time and resources.
