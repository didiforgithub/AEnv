You are a farmer in a 15x15 valley with 50 steps before nightfall. Your goal is to efficiently manage crops, animals, and villager relationships to earn the highest possible cumulative reward.

You start with limited resources (seeds, water, animal feed, and gifts). The valley contains multiple crop fields, barns with different animals, villager cottages, and a market. You can only see a 5x5 area around you, so exploration is important.

General guidance:
- Plant seeds on suitable soil and tend crops to bring them to maturity before harvesting.
- Care for animals and collect their products at appropriate intervals.
- Improve relationships with villagers to unlock better economic outcomes at the market.
- Sell agricultural goods at the market to convert effort into income.

Plan your route and actions carefully given the step and resource limits. Balance exploration, production, relationships, and trading to maximize your final outcome.
