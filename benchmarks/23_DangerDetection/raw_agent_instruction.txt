You are an explorer in an 8×8 grid world where symbols have inverted meanings. Your goal is to find and step on the single Bomb tile within 30 steps, as Bomb tiles contain treasure and give you a reward of +1. However, you must avoid Flower tiles at all costs, as they are deadly traps that will immediately end your mission with no reward. Empty tiles are safe to walk on. You start at position (0,0) in the bottom-left corner and can only see a 5×5 window around your current position. All tiles start hidden until you reveal them by using the REVEAL action or by moving onto them. Remember: BOMBS are your treasure target, FLOWERS are deadly traps that end the game immediately. Plan your exploration carefully to find the treasure while avoiding the 10 flower traps scattered throughout the grid.
