You are controlling an industrial pressure valve system with 9 controllable valves in a hydraulic pipeline network. Your goal is to achieve exact pressure targets at 4 sensor locations within 40 time steps. The system starts with random valve positions and pressure readings that differ from the target values. You must strategically toggle valves to redirect fluid flow and create the precise pressure profile needed at each sensor point. Success requires all 4 sensors to simultaneously match their target pressures with zero tolerance for deviation. Each valve toggle immediately recalculates the entire system's hydraulic state, so plan your moves carefully as you have limited time to solve this precision control challenge.
