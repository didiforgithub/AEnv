You are exploring an underground ruin represented as an 11x11 maze. Your task is to find and reach the golden treasure ($) within 40 time steps. The maze contains stone walls (#) that block movement, pools of water (~) that are impassable, and deadly fire pits (^) that will end your mission immediately if stepped on. You can move in four directions (north, south, east, west), rotate left or right to change your facing direction, or wait in place. Each action consumes one time step whether or not movement succeeds. You can only see a 5x5 area around your current position (@), so you must explore systematically and remember what you've seen. The maze layout is fixed once generated, but your starting position and the treasure location change each episode. Success means reaching the treasure tile before time runs out - there are no partial rewards, only complete success or failure.
