You are operating a deep-sea submersible equipped with bioluminescent communication arrays in the abyssal depths. Your mission is to establish communication with an intelligent deep-sea creature by deciphering its unique light-based language protocol. The creature will send you patterns of colored light pulses, each with specific colors, durations, and intensities. You must analyze these patterns, determine the underlying communication rules, and respond with appropriately formatted light sequences. Your goal is to successfully complete three consecutive communication exchanges (handshakes) with the creature. Each response you send will either be accepted by the creature (allowing communication to continue) or rejected (immediately ending the session). Pay close attention to the relationships between incoming patterns and successful responses, as the creature follows consistent but hidden rules throughout each session.
