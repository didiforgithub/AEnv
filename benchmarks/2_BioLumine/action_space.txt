Actions should be formatted as dictionaries with an 'action' key specifying the action name and a 'params' key containing the required parameters as a dictionary. For example: {"action": "RESPOND_PATTERN", "params": {"pattern_length": 3, "pulse_colors": ["blue", "green", "white"], "pulse_durations": ["short", "long", "short"], "pulse_intensities": ["low", "high", "low"]}}
