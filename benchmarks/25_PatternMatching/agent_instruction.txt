You are playing a memory card matching game. Your goal is to find and match all 8 pairs of cards within 40 steps. The environment presents a 4x4 grid of face-down cards, each containing one of 8 different symbols (with exactly 2 cards per symbol). You can flip cards one at a time to reveal their symbols. When you have exactly 2 cards revealed, they will automatically be checked for a match - if they match, both cards are permanently cleared; if they don't match, both cards are flipped face-down again. You must remember the positions and symbols of previously seen cards to efficiently find matching pairs. The game ends successfully when all 8 pairs are cleared, or unsuccessfully if you run out of steps.
