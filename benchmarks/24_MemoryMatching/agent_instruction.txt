You are in a 3x3 sliding tile puzzle environment with an inverted objective. Your task is to arrange the numbered tiles (1-8) and blank space into a specific chaotic pattern within exactly 30 moves. The target pattern is: [[2,7,5],[1,0,8],[4,6,3]] where 0 represents the blank space. You must avoid creating the conventional ordered pattern [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,0]] as this causes immediate failure. You can slide tiles by moving the blank space in four directions (up, down, left, right), but only if the movement is within the 3x3 grid boundaries. Each move consumes one step regardless of whether it's legal or illegal, so plan your moves carefully to reach the chaos pattern before running out of steps.
