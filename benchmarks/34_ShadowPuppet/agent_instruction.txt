You are controlling a shadow puppet in a reality manipulation laboratory. Your goal is to guide a target object into the designated goal area within 40 steps. The key mechanic is that shadows can transform the physical properties of objects - when your shadow overlaps with any object, that object immediately adopts the property symbolized by the shadow's shape. Square shadows create Heavy objects (immune to wind), circular shadows create Light objects (affected by wind pulses), triangular shadows create Bouncy objects (bounce off walls), and cross shadows create Sticky objects (adhere to other objects). Use these transformations strategically along with wind pulses to create chain reactions that will move your target object to the goal zone. Plan carefully as you have limited steps to succeed.
