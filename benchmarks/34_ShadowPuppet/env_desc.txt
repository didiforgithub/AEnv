The Shadow Puppet Reality Manipulation Environment presents a deterministic puzzle-solving challenge where agents learn to manipulate physical reality through strategic shadow casting. This environment operates on the core principle that shadows possess transformative power - when a shadow's silhouette overlaps with any real object, that object immediately adopts the physical properties symbolized by the shadow shape. The setting takes place within a controlled laboratory-like room where this supernatural phenomenon can be studied and mastered.

The primary objective requires the agent to guide a designated target object into a specific goal area within the room. Success is achieved when the target object comes to rest entirely within the goal zone boundaries at any point during the episode. The agent must accomplish this task within a strict 40-step limit, making efficient planning and execution crucial for success. The challenge lies in understanding how different shadow shapes affect object properties and leveraging these transformations to create the necessary chain of physical interactions that will move the target object to its destination.

The environment state is comprehensively structured around an 8×8 grid representing the room. The state includes the fixed position of the light source that enables shadow projection, along with clearly marked goal area coordinates. Up to four real objects populate the room, each maintaining a current position, an active property tag that determines its physical behavior, and a motion vector indicating its movement direction and speed. The current shadow shape being projected is tracked as part of the state, along with a countdown timer showing remaining steps. All state information is fully observable to the agent, ensuring that learning can focus on strategic decision-making rather than dealing with hidden variables or uncertainty.

The action space consists of discrete movement and manipulation options that provide comprehensive control over shadow projection. The agent can move the shadow horizontally or vertically by one grid cell in any direction, allowing precise positioning of the transformative effect. Shape cycling enables the agent to select from available shadow forms - square, circle, triangle, and cross - each corresponding to specific object properties. A toggle function allows the agent to turn shadow projection on or off, providing temporal control over when transformations occur. Additionally, a special wind pulse action creates a global environmental effect that pushes all Light objects away from the current shadow center, adding a dynamic element for large-scale object manipulation. The agent may also choose to take no action during any step, allowing time for ongoing physics interactions to resolve.

State transitions follow deterministic rules that ensure consistent learning experiences. When the agent selects a shadow movement or shape change, the shadow updates immediately. Object property transformations occur instantaneously when shadows overlap objects, with the mapping being completely predictable - square shadows create Heavy objects immune to wind effects, circular shadows produce Light objects susceptible to environmental forces, triangular shadows generate Bouncy objects that exhibit elastic collision behavior, and cross shadows form Sticky objects that adhere to other objects upon contact. After each agent action, a physics simulation step processes all object movements, applies any triggered wind effects, resolves collisions according to current object properties, and enforces rigid boundary constraints that keep all objects within the grid space.

The reward structure employs a binary system focused solely on task completion. The agent receives a reward of +1 immediately upon successfully placing the target object within the goal area, while all other outcomes yield zero reward. This binary approach creates clear success criteria without providing intermediate feedback that might bias learning toward suboptimal local strategies. The lack of partial rewards encourages agents to develop comprehensive solution strategies rather than getting trapped in reward-harvesting behaviors that don't lead to actual task completion.

Observations provide complete environmental awareness necessary for effective learning and strategic planning. The agent receives the full 8×8 grid layout showing all object positions, the goal area boundaries, and the light source location. Each object's current property state is clearly indicated, allowing the agent to understand the immediate consequences of different shadow applications. The current shadow shape and position are displayed, along with the remaining step count that creates urgency and planning constraints. Motion vectors for all objects are visible, enabling the agent to predict future positions and plan multi-step sequences. This comprehensive observation design ensures agents can identify patterns in object behavior, understand the consequences of their shadow manipulations, and develop sophisticated strategies that leverage the deterministic nature of the environment's physics system.

Episode termination occurs under three specific conditions that provide clear endpoints for learning episodes. Success termination happens immediately when the target object enters and remains within the goal area, accompanied by the positive reward signal. Failure termination occurs when the 40-step limit expires without achieving the objective, resulting in zero reward. A special failure condition handles cases where contradictory shadow overlaps create impossible object states, though the environment's design minimizes such occurrences through careful mechanics implementation.

The environment incorporates several special features designed to optimize learning effectiveness and ensure consistent challenge levels. Five distinct levels provide variety while maintaining identical rule sets, with difficulty controlled through initial object placement and goal positioning rather than rule changes. All physics behaviors, shadow-to-property mappings, step limits, and success criteria remain constant across levels, ensuring that learned strategies transfer effectively and that the environment remains truly learnable. Fixed random seeds for each level ensure reproducible training conditions while still providing sufficient variety to prevent overfitting. The 40-step episode limit fits comfortably within computational constraints while providing enough time for complex multi-step solutions, and the deterministic nature of all interactions ensures that apparent randomness never obscures the underlying learnable patterns that enable successful agent development.
