You are navigating a treacherous 8x8 icy terrain where appearances deceive. Your goal is to reach the Goal Flag (G) within 40 steps, but be careful - this world defies intuition. Dark holes (H) that look dangerous are actually safe to walk on, while bright ice surfaces (I) that appear solid will instantly end your mission if stepped on. You can only see a 3x3 area around your current position, so you must carefully explore and remember safe paths. Use the directional movement actions (MoveNorth, MoveSouth, MoveEast, MoveWest) to navigate or Wait if you need to pause. Success requires reaching the goal flag while avoiding all ice traps within your step limit.
