You are an engineer managing an advanced facility with four interconnected subsystems: Thermal Grid, Data Archive, Crystal Lattice, and Bio-Habitat. Your goal is to raise the Global Order Score from 0 to 100 points within 40 steps while keeping each domain's chaos level at or below 70 to prevent catastrophic system failure. You can inject energy to build your resource pool, reverse entropy to increase order (but this spreads chaos to other domains), redistribute order between domains, vent excess chaos, or temporarily lock down domains to prevent cross-system interference. The challenge lies in balancing local improvements against system-wide stability as entropy naturally propagates between connected domains.
