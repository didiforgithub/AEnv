You are the chief manager of an interstellar terraforming project tasked with transforming a hostile alien planet into a habitable world. Your goal is to raise the planet's Habitability Index from 0% to 100% within 40 time steps while preventing planetary collapse by keeping the Instability Index below 100%. You must carefully balance atmospheric composition (oxygen and carbon dioxide levels), activate water systems by converting subsurface ice to surface water, introduce biological processes through microbial seeding, maintain geological stability, and manage your energy reserves. Each action affects multiple interconnected planetary systems through complex feedback loops, so aggressive early interventions may cause dangerous instabilities later. Success requires strategic planning, resource management, and understanding how atmospheric, hydrological, geological, and biological systems influence each other in creating a stable, life-supporting environment.
