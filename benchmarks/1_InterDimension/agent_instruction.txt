You are an interdimensional broker operating across three parallel realities with different economic systems. Your goal is to accumulate at least 100 arbitrage credits by exploiting exchange rate differences between dimensions while maintaining diplomatic relationships to avoid trade embargos.

The three dimensions use different currencies: Mass Credits (based on physical properties), Entropy Notes (based on thermodynamic disorder), and Historical Bonds (based on temporal significance). Exchange rates between these currencies fluctuate according to hidden patterns, but you only observe noisy versions of the true rates.

You start with a random inventory of items and small balances in each dimensional currency. You must strategically trade items, convert currencies, and manage diplomatic relations. Be careful - if any dimension's embargo risk reaches 100%, all trading stops and the episode ends. You have exactly 40 steps to achieve your profit target.

Key strategies include: identifying profitable arbitrage opportunities despite noisy exchange rate observations, using research actions to improve rate accuracy, hedging to temporarily stabilize rates, and donating items to reduce embargo risks when diplomatic tensions rise too high.
