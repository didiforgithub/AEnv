You are the overseer of a living city where buildings are sentient entities with personalities, needs, and relationships. Your task is to guide this unique metropolis to achieve 100 City Synergy points through careful management and diplomacy. Each building has its own integrity, energy reserves, trust toward you, growth stage, and emotional mood that influences its behavior. You must balance individual building needs with collective harmony while managing limited city resources like bio-materials and energy. Success requires building trust through negotiation, resolving conflicts between incompatible building personalities, supporting growth while maintaining structural integrity, and fostering cooperation that creates synergy cascades when multiple buildings maintain high trust simultaneously. Failure occurs if any building's trust or integrity drops to zero, causing city collapse. You have 40 steps to achieve your goal in this delicate ecosystem of architectural consciousness.
