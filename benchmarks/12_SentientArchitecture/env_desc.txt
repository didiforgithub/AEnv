# Sentient Architecture Management Environment Design Document

## Background

The Sentient Architecture Management Environment presents a unique urban planning challenge where the agent takes on the role of a city overseer managing a living metropolis. In this world, buildings are not mere structures but sentient entities with their own consciousness, personalities, and desires. Each building possesses individual traits including integrity levels, energy reserves, trust relationships with the agent, and distinct emotional states that influence their behavior. The city exists as a complex ecosystem where these architectural beings interact with each other and respond to the agent's management decisions. The environment draws inspiration from symbiotic relationships in nature, where successful coexistence requires understanding, negotiation, and careful resource allocation rather than simple command and control.

## Objective

The agent must successfully guide the sentient city to achieve a total City Synergy score of 100 points while preventing catastrophic failure. Success requires maintaining the delicate balance between individual building needs and collective harmony, ensuring that no building's Trust or Integrity falls to zero, which would trigger city collapse. The challenge lies in understanding each building's unique personality and needs while fostering cooperation and growth across the entire urban ecosystem.

## State Setup

The environment initializes with a city containing between four to eight sentient buildings, each spawning with randomized but balanced attributes. Every building begins with Integrity values ranging from 60 to 80 points, Energy Reserves between 20 to 35 units, and Trust levels toward the agent from 50 to 70 points. Buildings start in the Seedling growth stage with mood tags randomly assigned from a pool including Calm, Restless, Ambitious, Contemplative, and Energetic states. The global city begins with Bio-material stock between 40 to 60 units, Energy grid capacity from 80 to 120 units, and a Harmony index starting at 50 points. City Synergy initializes at zero, representing the absence of established cooperative relationships. The step counter begins at zero with a maximum limit of 40 steps per episode.

## Actions

The agent can perform one action per step, choosing from seven distinct intervention types. The Negotiate action targets a specific building to engage in dialogue, potentially altering both Trust levels and mood states through diplomatic interaction. AllocateEnergy transfers specified energy units from the city grid to a chosen building's reserves, with the transfer amount bounded by available grid capacity. SupplyBioMaterial provides construction materials to buildings, limited by current stock levels and essential for growth and repair processes. The Mediate action addresses conflicts between two specific buildings, working to resolve tensions and improve the overall Harmony index. StimulateGrowth pushes a targeted building toward its next developmental stage, requiring careful timing and resource support. The Repair action directly restores a building's Integrity using specified resource units. Finally, CityFestival serves as a global action that boosts mood and trust levels across all buildings simultaneously, though at significant resource cost.

## State Transition Rule

Each action triggers specific state changes that ripple through the city ecosystem. When negotiating with buildings, the agent's historical interaction patterns influence Trust modifications, with consistent positive engagement building stronger relationships over time. Energy allocation immediately transfers units from the city grid to building reserves, while simultaneously reducing available grid capacity until natural regeneration occurs. Bio-material supply increases a building's construction resources, enabling growth and maintenance activities during subsequent steps. Mediation between buildings reduces conflict markers and boosts the Harmony index, which amplifies the effectiveness of all subsequent Trust and Integrity changes. Growth stimulation advances a building's developmental stage but temporarily reduces Integrity as the structure adapts to its new form. Repair actions directly restore Integrity by converting bio-materials into structural improvements. City festivals create widespread positive effects but significantly drain both energy and bio-material reserves. Between agent actions, the city exhibits autonomous behavior as buildings naturally regenerate small amounts of energy and bio-materials, while their mood states and inter-building relationships evolve based on current conditions and the Harmony index.

## Rewards

The environment employs a cumulative reward structure where all earned points contribute to the agent's total score without discounting. Trust Increase rewards provide 0.2 points for each net Trust point gained across all buildings during a single step, encouraging relationship building. Integrity Maintenance awards 1 point per step when every building maintains Integrity levels at or above 70 points, promoting preventive care over crisis management. Successful Growth events provide 3 points when a building completes its transition to a new developmental stage, rewarding strategic development timing. Conflict Resolution grants 2 points when mediation successfully prevents Integrity loss, emphasizing diplomatic problem-solving. Synergy Cascade events deliver 5 points when triggered by having three or more buildings simultaneously maintain Trust levels of 80 or higher, encouraging widespread relationship cultivation. The ultimate Objective Completion reward provides 50 points when City Synergy first reaches the target of 100 points. The reward system contains no negative values, relying instead on the absence of positive feedback to signal suboptimal decisions.

## Observation

The agent receives comprehensive state information designed to support strategic decision-making while maintaining appropriate complexity. Building-specific observations include current Integrity levels ranging from 0 to 100, Energy Reserve quantities from 0 to 50 units, Trust values toward the agent from 0 to 100, current Growth Stage classifications as Seedling, Mature, or Monumental, and descriptive mood tags that provide insight into each building's emotional state. Global city information encompasses Bio-material stock levels, total Energy grid capacity, and the Harmony index that reflects aggregate mood balance across the urban ecosystem. The critical City Synergy score provides direct feedback on progress toward the primary objective, while the step counter maintains awareness of time constraints. These observations are structured to provide actionable intelligence that helps agents identify patterns in building behavior, recognize emerging conflicts, understand resource flows, and make informed decisions about intervention timing and resource allocation priorities.

## Termination

Episode termination occurs under three distinct conditions that reflect different outcome scenarios. Failure termination triggers immediately when any building's Integrity or Trust drops to zero or below, representing the onset of city collapse as critical relationships break down or infrastructure fails catastrophically. Success termination occurs when the City Synergy score reaches or exceeds 100 points, indicating that the agent has successfully fostered sufficient cooperation and harmony among the sentient buildings. Time limit termination activates after 40 steps regardless of current city state, ensuring episodes maintain reasonable duration for learning purposes while creating urgency for strategic decision-making.

## Special Features

The environment incorporates several unique mechanics that distinguish it from traditional resource management scenarios. The Sentient Negotiation system creates dynamic relationship building where each building maintains memory of recent agent interactions, causing Trust changes to reflect historical treatment patterns rather than single-action outcomes. Adaptive Growth mechanics mean that developmental progress brings both opportunities and risks, as advancing Growth Stages increase building capabilities while temporarily reducing Integrity if proper resource support is not provided. Inter-Building Relationships create emergent complexity through the Harmony index, which modulates the magnitude of all Trust and Integrity changes while allowing conflicts to spontaneously emerge between buildings with incompatible mood states. Resource Flow dynamics introduce scarcity feedback where large resource withdrawals can create temporary shortages despite steady regeneration rates. Synergy Cascades provide powerful positive feedback loops when widespread cooperation emerges, creating substantial City Synergy bonuses when multiple buildings simultaneously maintain high Trust levels. The environment maintains strict consistency across all difficulty levels, with identical state variables, transition dynamics, and reward magnitudes ensuring that learning transfers effectively between episodes without curriculum effects that could confuse agent training processes.
