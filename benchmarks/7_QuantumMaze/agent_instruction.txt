You are an agent navigating a 10x10 quantum maze where walls exist in superposition until observed. Your goal is to reach the exit at position [9,9] starting from [0,0] within exactly 40 steps. Unlike normal mazes, wall segments are initially unknown (quantum) and only become solid walls or empty spaces when you observe them by moving to adjacent cells or using the OBSERVE action. Each wall has a probability between 0.2-0.5 of becoming solid when collapsed. Plan your path carefully - you can observe multiple adjacent cells at once without moving using OBSERVE, or move to automatically observe and potentially enter a cell. The maze structure emerges through your actions, so strategic observation is key to finding viable paths to the exit.
