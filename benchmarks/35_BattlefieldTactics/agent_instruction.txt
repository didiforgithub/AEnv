You are commanding a reconnaissance squad in a tactical military operation. Your mission is to locate and eliminate two hidden enemy camps on a 15x15 battlefield within 40 tactical steps. You control three squads, each with different combat strengths, starting from the northwest corner. The battlefield contains walls and dense forests that block both movement and vision, creating a fog-of-war environment where you can only see areas within a 3-tile radius of your active squads. Each enemy camp has defensive strength between 2-6 points, and to successfully eliminate a camp, the combined strength of all your squads adjacent to the target must exceed the camp's defense. Failed attacks will destroy all participating squads. Balance exploration speed with tactical positioning - you must find both camps quickly while ensuring sufficient force concentration for successful assaults.
