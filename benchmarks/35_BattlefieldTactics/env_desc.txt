## Background

The Squad Reconnaissance and Elimination Environment simulates a tactical military scenario where an agent commands a small reconnaissance force tasked with eliminating enemy strongholds. The battlefield is a 15×15 discrete grid representing varied terrain including open ground, impassable walls, and dense forest that blocks both movement and vision. Two enemy camps of unknown strength and location are hidden across this battlefield, requiring careful exploration and tactical coordination to defeat. Each friendly squad operates as an autonomous unit under the agent's command, equipped with sensors that provide limited reconnaissance capabilities within their immediate vicinity. The environment emphasizes fog-of-war mechanics where information gathering through positioning and movement becomes as crucial as combat effectiveness.

## Objective

The agent must successfully locate and eliminate both hidden enemy camps within a strict 40-step time limit. Victory requires tactical intelligence gathering to discover enemy positions followed by coordinated assault operations. Each enemy camp possesses defensive strength ranging from 2 to 6 points, and elimination requires that the combined combat strength of all attacking squads exceeds the camp's defensive capability. The agent must balance speed of exploration against force concentration, as premature attacks with insufficient strength will result in squad losses while excessive caution may lead to mission timeout.

## State Setup

Each episode begins with environmental initialization where two enemy camps are randomly placed on valid grid positions (avoiding walls and starting positions) and assigned random strength values between 2 and 6 points. Three friendly reconnaissance squads spawn at predetermined starting positions near one corner of the battlefield, each assigned random combat strength between 1 and 4 points. The terrain layout includes strategically placed walls forming partial barriers and forest patches that create vision-blocking obstacles, forcing squads to navigate around or through chokepoints to fully explore the battlefield. All enemy positions remain hidden until squads move within detection range, ensuring that each episode requires active exploration rather than predetermined movement patterns.

## Actions

The agent issues simultaneous orders to all active squads each step, selecting from six available commands per squad. The HoldPosition action maintains the squad's current location while continuing to provide reconnaissance of the surrounding area. Movement actions include MoveNorth, MoveSouth, MoveEast, and MoveWest, each attempting to relocate the squad one grid cell in the specified direction. Invalid movement commands such as moving into walls or forest terrain will consume the action but leave the squad in its original position. The AttackEnemyCamp action can only be executed when an enemy camp is adjacent to the squad and requires careful coordination since the attack's success depends on the combined strength of all adjacent friendly units, not just the attacking squad.

## State Transition Rule

Squad movement follows standard grid-based mechanics where successful movement commands update unit positions by one cell in the specified direction, while failed movements due to terrain obstacles leave positions unchanged but still consume the action. When squads move to new positions, their 7×7 sensor radius reveals previously unexplored areas, potentially discovering enemy camps or confirming clear terrain. Attack actions trigger combat resolution where the system calculates total friendly strength from all squads adjacent to the target enemy camp, comparing this value against the camp's defensive strength. Successful attacks immediately remove the enemy camp from the battlefield and award appropriate rewards, while failed attacks destroy all participating squads, removing them permanently from the current episode. The step counter decrements by one after all squad actions are processed, regardless of action success or failure.

## Rewards

The environment employs a cumulative reward structure with a maximum possible total of 1.0 points per episode. The agent receives +0.5 points immediately upon eliminating the first enemy camp, demonstrating successful reconnaissance and tactical coordination. An additional +0.5 points are awarded when the second enemy camp is destroyed, completing the mission objective and maximizing the episode reward. This binary milestone approach encourages agents to prioritize complete mission success rather than optimizing for partial objectives, while the cumulative nature allows for meaningful progress evaluation during training. No negative rewards are applied for squad losses or inefficient actions, maintaining focus on positive achievement rather than penalty avoidance.

## Observation

The agent receives comprehensive tactical information structured around squad-centric reconnaissance data and global mission status. For each of the three squads, the observation includes precise grid coordinates, current combat strength, and operational status indicating whether the unit remains active or has been destroyed in combat. The primary intelligence component consists of a merged tactical map combining 7×7 local views centered on each active squad's position, revealing terrain types including free spaces, walls, forest, and any visible enemy camps or friendly units within sensor range. Global mission parameters provide strategic context through enemy elimination progress displayed as a fraction (eliminated camps / total camps), remaining step budget, and total available friendly combat strength across all active squads. This observation structure enables agents to make informed tactical decisions by providing both immediate local intelligence and broader strategic awareness necessary for effective force coordination and mission planning.

## Termination

Episodes conclude under three distinct conditions that reflect different mission outcomes. The primary success condition occurs when both enemy camps have been eliminated, immediately ending the episode with maximum reward regardless of remaining steps or squad losses. Time-based termination activates when the 40-step limit expires, representing mission failure due to inability to complete objectives within operational constraints. Total force elimination provides the final termination condition, triggered when all three friendly squads have been destroyed through failed combat operations, leaving the agent unable to continue mission execution. Upon any termination condition, the environment automatically resets for the next episode with newly randomized enemy positions, strength values, and squad capabilities, ensuring that learned strategies must generalize across varying tactical scenarios rather than memorizing specific configurations.

## Special Features

The environment incorporates several unique mechanics that distinguish it from standard grid-world scenarios. The fog-of-war system creates dynamic information revelation where battlefield knowledge expands only through active squad positioning, forcing agents to balance exploration against defensive positioning. Force coordination requirements mean that combat effectiveness depends not just on individual squad capabilities but on tactical positioning that brings multiple units within striking range of target objectives. The strength-based combat system introduces resource management considerations where agents must evaluate whether current forces are sufficient for immediate assault or if additional positioning and coordination are necessary. Random strength assignment for both friendly and enemy units ensures that optimal strategies must adapt to varying force ratios rather than relying on fixed tactical approaches. The strict step limit creates persistent time pressure that prevents excessive exploration and demands efficient decision-making throughout the episode duration.
