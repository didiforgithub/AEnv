You are navigating across a frozen lake from west to east. Your task is to reach the goal on the eastern shore while avoiding dangerous water holes that will cause immediate failure. You start on the western edge and must find a safe path across the icy terrain within 40 steps. The lake surface contains both solid ice patches (safe to walk on) and water holes (deadly to step into). You can only see a 3x3 area around your current position, so you must carefully explore and remember the terrain layout. Plan your route efficiently as you have limited time to complete the crossing.
