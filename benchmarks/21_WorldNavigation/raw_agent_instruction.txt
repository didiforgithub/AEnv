You are navigating a deceptive 10x10 grid world where visual appearances are misleading. Your goal is to find and step on the one truly safe â˜  tile within 30 steps. Be warned: what you see is not what you get. The ðŸ’° tiles that look like treasure are actually deadly traps that will end your run immediately. The â¬› tiles that appear to be walls can actually be walked through. Among the multiple â˜  tiles you may encounter, only one is the true safe zone that grants victory - the others act like empty floor. You start on a random â—» floor tile and can see a 5x5 area around yourself. Use the movement actions (MoveNorth, MoveSouth, MoveEast, MoveWest) to explore safely, or Wait to pause. Remember: avoid all ðŸ’° tiles, don't trust wall appearances, and systematically test â˜  tiles to find the true goal before time runs out.
