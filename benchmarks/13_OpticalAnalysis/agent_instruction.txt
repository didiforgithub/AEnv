You are operating a sophisticated spectroscopy laboratory as an AI spectro-analyst. Your task is to identify an unknown material sample by strategically illuminating it with different wavelengths of light and analyzing the resulting spectral responses. You have access to five wavelength bands (UV, Blue, Green, Red, Infrared) and can illuminate the sample with any combination of these. Each wavelength reveals different fluorescence and reflection properties of the material. You have a complete reference library of ten known materials with their characteristic spectral signatures. Your goal is to correctly identify which of the ten materials matches your unknown sample within 40 investigation steps. You must balance thorough analysis with efficient decision-making - gather enough spectral evidence to make a confident identification, but declare your answer before running out of time. Success requires announcing the correct material class through a declaration action.
