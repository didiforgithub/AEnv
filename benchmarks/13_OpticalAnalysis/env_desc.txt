## Background

The Light Spectrum Analysis Environment simulates a sophisticated virtual spectroscopy laboratory where an AI agent operates as an automated spectro-analyst. In this controlled setting, the agent is presented with unknown material samples placed under a precision monochromator system capable of selective wavelength illumination. The laboratory maintains a comprehensive reference database of ten distinct material classes, each with well-characterized spectral properties that reflect real-world photonic behaviors. Materials in the catalog include water-based gels, crystalline silica, metallic copper samples, and specialized organic dyes, among others. Each material exhibits consistent and physically plausible optical responses—water-rich samples demonstrate strong infrared absorption with characteristic blue fluorescence, metallic substances show pronounced visible-spectrum reflection with minimal fluorescent emission, while organic compounds often display UV-activated fluorescence patterns. The laboratory environment ensures perfect measurement conditions with no instrumental noise or environmental interference, allowing the agent to focus purely on spectral analysis methodology and decision-making strategies.

## Objective

The agent's primary mission is to correctly identify the material composition of a single unknown sample within a constrained investigation period. Each episode begins with a mystery sample positioned under the monochromator, and the agent must determine which of the ten catalogued material classes best matches the specimen through systematic spectral interrogation. Success requires the agent to announce the correct material identification before exhausting its allocated forty-step investigation budget. The challenge lies not merely in gathering spectral data, but in efficiently selecting the most informative wavelength combinations while balancing thoroughness against time constraints. The agent must develop strategic approaches to maximize information gain from each illumination choice, learning to recognize when sufficient evidence has been collected to make a confident declaration rather than continuing potentially redundant measurements.

## State Setup

The environment initializes each episode by randomly selecting one material from the ten-class catalog as the unknown sample, ensuring uniform distribution across all material types over multiple episodes. The state representation provides complete observability of all relevant laboratory conditions and accumulated data. The current step counter begins at zero and increments with each action, providing clear progress tracking toward the forty-step limit. A five-dimensional binary vector records which spectral bands have been previously projected, initially set to all zeros representing no prior illumination. The observed spectrum consists of two five-element arrays representing fluorescence and reflection intensities across UV, Blue, Green, Red, and Infrared wavelengths, initially containing zeros until illumination begins. Most importantly, the complete reference spectral library is provided as a ten-by-ten matrix, where each row represents one material class and contains its canonical ten-element spectral signature covering both fluorescence and reflection responses under individual band illumination. This reference data remains constant across all episodes, allowing agents to develop consistent analytical strategies while only the target material varies between sessions.

## Actions

The agent possesses sixteen distinct actions organized into two functional categories. The illumination actions include EmitUV, EmitBlue, EmitGreen, EmitRed, and EmitIR, each adding the corresponding wavelength band to the cumulative illumination set currently projected onto the sample. These emission actions exhibit idempotent behavior, meaning repeated activation of the same wavelength produces no additional spectral changes beyond the initial application. The declaration actions comprise Declare_0 through Declare_9, where each corresponds to announcing identification of a specific material class from the reference catalog. All actions consume exactly one step from the forty-step budget regardless of their type or effectiveness. The environment accepts any selected action as valid, ensuring no illegal moves can occur, though strategic action selection remains crucial for successful material identification within the time constraint.

## State Transition Rule

Upon execution of illumination actions, the environment updates the cumulative wavelength set by activating the corresponding spectral band if not already present. The observed spectrum undergoes recalculation using element-wise maximum aggregation across all currently active wavelengths, where each spectral element represents the peak response achievable from any single active band rather than additive combination. This maximum-based accumulation reflects realistic laboratory conditions where dominant spectral features emerge from optimal wavelength matching rather than simple linear superposition. When declaration actions are executed, the environment immediately compares the announced material class against the true sample identity, recording success or failure status and triggering episode termination. Throughout all transitions, the step counter increments and remaining budget decreases, while the reference library and episode target material remain unchanged. The deterministic nature of spectral calculations ensures identical outcomes for equivalent action sequences, supporting consistent learning experiences across multiple episodes.

## Rewards

The environment implements a binary reward structure focused exclusively on final identification accuracy. The agent receives a reward of positive one if and only if its first declaration action correctly matches the ground-truth material class within the forty-step time limit. All other outcomes, including incorrect declarations and timeout scenarios where no declaration occurs before step exhaustion, result in zero reward. No intermediate rewards, progress bonuses, or penalty deductions are applied during the investigation process, compelling agents to balance information gathering thoroughness against decisive action timing. This binary framework emphasizes the critical importance of both accurate analysis and efficient resource utilization, as perfect spectral matching provides no benefit without timely declaration, while hasty guessing undermines the systematic approach required for reliable material identification.

## Observation

The observation space provides comprehensive visibility into all laboratory conditions and accumulated experimental data necessary for informed decision-making. Agents receive the current step count and remaining budget, enabling precise resource management and deadline awareness throughout the investigation. The cumulative illumination status appears as a clear binary indicator showing which wavelength bands have been activated, preventing redundant emissions while highlighting unexplored spectral regions. The resulting observed spectrum presents both fluorescence and reflection intensity measurements across all five wavelength categories, with values normalized between zero and one for consistent interpretation. Each spectral measurement represents the maximum response achieved by any currently active wavelength band, providing monotonically increasing information content as additional bands are activated. The complete reference library accompanies every observation, displaying canonical spectral signatures for all ten material classes under individual wavelength illumination. This comprehensive reference enables direct comparison between observed and expected spectral patterns, though agents must still determine optimal band selection strategies and appropriate stopping criteria for investigation completeness.

## Termination

Episode termination occurs under two distinct conditions that reflect the fundamental constraints of laboratory analysis workflows. Immediate termination follows any declaration action, regardless of correctness, simulating the irreversible nature of formal analytical conclusions in professional laboratory settings. Alternative termination occurs when the forty-step budget is completely exhausted without any declaration, representing investigation timeout and analytical failure. The binary nature of these termination conditions eliminates ambiguous ending scenarios while emphasizing the critical balance between thorough investigation and decisive conclusion timing that characterizes effective analytical methodology.

## Special Features

The environment incorporates several distinctive mechanisms that enhance both realism and learning effectiveness. The spectral accumulation system employs element-wise maximum combination rather than additive superposition, reflecting authentic laboratory conditions where optimal wavelength matching reveals dominant spectral characteristics. Commonsense semantic consistency ensures that material behaviors align with everyday physical understanding—organic compounds exhibit UV-induced fluorescence, metals demonstrate strong visible reflection with minimal fluorescence, and water-based samples show characteristic infrared absorption patterns. The complete observability of the reference spectral library transforms the challenge from pattern discovery to strategic investigation planning, requiring agents to develop efficient experimental methodologies rather than memorizing hidden information. Deterministic spectral calculations guarantee reproducible results for identical action sequences, enabling systematic strategy development and fair performance evaluation. The fixed forty-step budget creates meaningful resource constraints that prevent exhaustive search approaches while demanding efficient information prioritization. Finally, the environment maintains absolute rule consistency across all episodes, with difficulty variation arising solely from material selection rather than parameter modifications or added complexity layers.
