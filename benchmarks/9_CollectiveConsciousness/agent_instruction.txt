You are the central coordinator of an advanced collective intelligence civilization where millions of minds have merged into interconnected streams of consciousness. Your task is to govern this hive mind over 40 time steps, maintaining critical balance while driving intellectual progress. You must keep Unity at or above 70% and Diversity at or above 50% to prevent catastrophic collapse or stagnation. Simultaneously, you must grow the collective Knowledge Score from 0 to 200 points through coordinated mental efforts. You control sub-streams of consciousness that can be merged for unity, split for diversity, stimulated for creativity, meditated for coherence, or archived for permanent knowledge. Each decision affects the delicate balance between mental alignment and intellectual variety, while managing limited Cognitive Energy resources that regenerate each turn.
